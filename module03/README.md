The lines queue.notify(); and queue.wait(); are used for thread synchronization in the context of the producer-consumer pattern. Let's break down what each of these methods does and why they are used together in your Hen and Egg classes.

1. queue.notify();
Purpose:

The notify() method is used to wake up a single thread that is waiting on the same object's monitor (in this case, queue).
In the producer-consumer pattern, this is typically used by a producer after producing an item to signal the consumer that there is something to consume, or by the consumer after consuming an item to signal the producer that there is space to produce more items.
How it works:

When a thread calls notify(), it wakes up one of the threads that called wait() on the same object. However, it doesn’t release the lock immediately—it will continue to hold the lock until it exits the synchronized block.
In your code:

When queue.notify(); is called, it wakes up the other thread (either Hen or Egg), which is waiting on the same queue object. This allows the other thread to continue its execution.
2. queue.wait();
Purpose:

The wait() method is used to make the current thread wait until another thread calls notify() (or notifyAll()) on the same object. The waiting thread releases the lock it holds on that object so that other threads can synchronize on it.
How it works:

When a thread calls wait(), it pauses its execution and releases the lock it holds on the object. The thread will remain in a waiting state until another thread calls notify() (or notifyAll()) on the same object.
In your code:

After producing an item and notifying the other thread, the producer (or consumer) calls wait() if it has more work to do (i.e., i < count - 1).
This makes the current thread pause until the other thread has consumed the item and called notify() again.

Life Cycle and Synchronization Behavior:
Hen Thread Starts First:

Step 1: The Hen thread enters the synchronized(queue) block.
Step 2: The Hen thread produces "Hen" and places it in the queue.
Step 3: The Hen thread prints the value "Hen".
Step 4: The Hen thread calls queue.notify(), which will notify any other thread waiting on queue (if there is one). However, the notified thread cannot proceed immediately because the Hen thread still holds the lock on queue.
Step 5: The Hen thread then calls queue.wait(). This makes the Hen thread release the lock on queue and enter the waiting state, allowing the Egg thread to acquire the lock on queue.
Egg Thread Starts After Hen Thread Calls wait():

Step 6: After the Hen thread calls queue.wait() and releases the lock, the Egg thread can now enter its synchronized(queue) block.
Step 7: The Egg thread produces "Egg" and places it in the queue.
Step 8: The Egg thread prints the value "Egg".
Step 9: The Egg thread calls queue.notify(), which will wake up the Hen thread (which is waiting on queue).
Step 10: The Egg thread then checks if (i < count - 1) and calls queue.wait(), releasing the lock and entering the waiting state.
Hen Thread Resumes:

Step 11: After the Egg thread calls queue.notify() and releases the lock by calling queue.wait(), the Hen thread (which was waiting) can now reacquire the lock on queue and continue execution from where it left off.
Summary of Synchronization:
Single Lock on queue: Both the Hen and Egg threads synchronize on the same queue object, meaning only one thread can hold the lock on queue at any given time.
Lock Prevents Concurrent Execution: While one thread is inside its synchronized(queue) block, the other thread cannot enter its synchronized(queue) block until the first thread releases the lock.
Use of wait() and notify(): The wait() call releases the lock and puts the thread into a waiting state, allowing the other thread to acquire the lock and enter its synchronized(queue) block. The notify() call is used to wake up the waiting thread so that it can try to acquire the lock when it becomes available.
